## Challenge Of Out-Of-Label (COOOL) Benchmark for Hazard Detection
----
The COOOL benchmark is a collection of dashcam oriented videos (currently ~200) which have been annotated by human labelers to identify objects of interest and potential hazards to the vehicle driving. The dataset includes a wide variety of hazards and neussiance objects. Due to the size of the dataset and complexity of the data, this is an evaluation only benchmark.
